# Overview
This project was created with the help of HTML and JS. A lot of the API information was helped by a third-party application named MongoDB that allowed for the creation of an API document.
With the help of MongoDB, a medium to display the outputs that a user puts in, I modified the API document from the connections made in the code written in JS. 

This project aimed to show that I can work with different node.js packages like MongoDB, swagger-ui-express, express, dotenv, and much more.
